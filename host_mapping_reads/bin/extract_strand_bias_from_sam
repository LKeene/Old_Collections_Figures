my $usage = <<USAGE;

This script reads and outputs the ratio of reads mapped 
in a forward direction to reads mapped in reverse direction 
from SAM format data.

This is calculated from the 0x10 flag in the sam format output.  
According to the sam format spec, this flag indicates:

0x10 SEQ being reverse complemented

For each alignment if this flag is not set then the read is tallied
as being aligned in the forward direction.  Otherwise, it's tallied
as being aligned in the reverse direction.  

This script doesn't accunt for paired reads.  In other words,
this script will work for mapping of single-end data or just the 
first read of a pair.  Could be updated to accomodate that [TODO].

   -c     output the counts of +strand-mapping, -strand-mapping reads with a tab inbetween
          (the default behavior is to output the ratio of +strand-mapping:-strand-mapping)
