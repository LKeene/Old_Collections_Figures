# Location of R scripts used for data analysis and visualization

This directory contains the R scripts used for data visualization and statistical analysis for figures in this manuscript.

MLRs.R: script for the multiple linear regression analyses perfromed on RNA concentration and length.
Meta_Data_Concentration_graph.R: script to generate figures of the museum collection RNA cocnentrations.
OC_Tables: script to generate the .png tables.
RNA_Over_Time.R: script for RT-qPCR data visualization and RNA cocentration visulaization.
UnusedCode.R: Code that was part of the analysis but removed.
collect_metadata.R: Cleanup of metadata for downstream analyses.
plot_colors.R: script containing colors used across plots.
qPCR_Data_Cleaning.R: script that takes raw qPCR data and transforms it into a tidy format for downstream analysis.
rates_figure.R: script for supplemental figure 5.
sample_map.R: script to generate a map of where and when museum samples were taken.
virus_pre_abs.R: script for figure 3.
plot_RNA_size_distributions_and_yield_LK.R: script that takes Bioanalyzer output data and generates figures of the average RNA length in experimental and museum specimens.
plot_tape_data.R: script to generate supplemental figure 3.
